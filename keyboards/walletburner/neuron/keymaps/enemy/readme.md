# Enemys' Neuron Layout

This layout is partically inspired by the planck layout which is why some keys like - and = are in the same positions and should help the ease of switching over. 
Unlike the Planck layout the enter key on homerow which i did because having and ' there and ; on a layer felt weird to me.
